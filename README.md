# Scripts for home data backup

## What it is
Scripts to backup mac user data (Appplication, hoee folder, `/Library`, and a SSD) to an external hard drive. Launched daily with `cron`.

## Easy installation

``bin/install.sh``

Warning: this will create `~/bin` and `~/log` if necessary, and will overwrite any existing user crontab.
