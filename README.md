# Scripts for home data backup

## What it is
Scripts run with `cron` to backup mac user data (Appplication, hoee folder, `/Library`, and a SSD) to an external hard drive every night.

## Installation

``bin/install.sh``

Warning: this will create `~/bin`, `~/conf`, and will override any existing user crontab.
