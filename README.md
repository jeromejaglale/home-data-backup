# Home Data Backup

## What it is
Shell scripts + crontab to backup my mac user data (Appplication, home folder, `/Library`, and a SSD) to an external hard drive, every night.

## Easy installation

``bin/install.sh``

Warning: this will create `~/bin` and `~/log` if necessary, and will overwrite any existing user crontab.
