# Home Data Backup

## What is it?
Shell scripts + crontab to backup my mac user data (Applications, home folder, `/Library`, and an external SSD) to an external hard drive, every night.

## Quick install

``bin/install.sh``

Warning: creates `~/bin` and `~/log` if necessary, and will overwrite any existing user crontab.
